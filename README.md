### Inspiration
🌟✨ In our world, every day is a canvas painted with the vibrant colors of life's experiences! We're a bubbly bunch of girl students, passionate about Computer Science at New York University, and we simply adore anime. 💖👩‍💻 Our hearts beat for the whimsical stories and charming characters that fill our screens. This magical mix of our daily giggles, combined with the exciting challenges of this hackathon, lights up our creative fire! 🎨🌈 It's this sparkling inspiration that guides us in crafting our delightful game, stitching together bits of our own adventures with a sprinkle of anime magic! 🌸💫

### What it does
🌸✨ Welcome to the adorable world of Miya, a sweet and smart girl studying Computer Science at New York University! In this super cute game, you'll dive into Miya's colorful life, filled with fun challenges and giggles. 🎀💻 🌈 In our first mini-game, you'll help our darling Miya pack her bag. But oh no! You can't just toss everything in. It's a delightful puzzle to pick the most perfect items for her day. Will you choose the sparkly notebook or the fluffy pen? Decisions, decisions! 🎒✏️ 💦 The second mini-game is all about a rainy adventure! Picture this: Miya just stepped out of class, her laptop in hand, and whoosh! It starts to rain, and our poor Miya doesn’t have an umbrella! 😱🌧️ Use your magical mouse skills to help her dance through the raindrops, keeping her and her laptop dry and safe. It's a race against the rain, filled with laughter and excitement! 🌂💕 So, put on your cutest thinking cap and join Miya in this charming game, where every day is a mix of fun, learning, and adorable surprises! 🌟🌸

### Our Sparkling Achievements 🌟💖
We're absolutely beaming with pride over what we've created! ✨ Each of us brought our own special sprinkle of talent, mixing it all together into a dazzling display of teamwork. 🧚‍♀️🌈

Our creation isn't just a blend of cute and clever - it's a shining example of our skills coming to life! And guess what? We all clicked like stars in a constellation, crafting something that makes our hearts sing with joy. 🌟💕

It's like we've woven a little magic, transforming our individual strengths into a project that's both adorable and amazing. We're super thrilled with what we've achieved together! 🎀🚀

### 🌟✨ Our Learning Adventure! 📚💕
In our journey of creating this adorable game, each of us twinkled in our own special areas, like stars in a dreamy night sky. 🌙✨ But, oh! We also sprinkled a bit of our magic into each other's worlds, sharing our sparkly skills and knowledge. It was like a cozy tea party, but with learning! 🍵🎀

For most of us, this was our very first hackathon. Imagine! Stepping into a wonderland of new experiences and discoveries. 🎉👩‍💻 It was absolutely fantastic, like opening a treasure chest of new ideas and friendships. Every moment was a precious gem, adding to our treasure trove of memories and skills. 💖🌈

So, not only did we create a game, but we also wove a beautiful tapestry of learning and growing together, making our first hackathon a truly enchanting experience! 🌸🚀
